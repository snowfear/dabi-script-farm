# dabi-script-farm
this one is for dabi in the new map

It pretty much adds new features to the original one such as working with Shock absorption quirk, and spam the fo the swing remote, so you might want to get a dagger or so, I fixed a stupid bug where somehow it stopped teleporting to the dabi's location so lmk any new bugs (I am conscious the function itself is kinda messy with the booleans and stuff but it works so)
